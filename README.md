# RGB_Thresholding
This application has two parts. In the rgb_thresholding.py, the user selects the image source using a tkinter window and then adapts the thresholding limits live. 
To save the limits the user should press 'w', to exit 'e' and to load the last saved limits 'q'. Then to apply the limits in a random image just load it to apply_limits.py 
and let the code do its magic.
